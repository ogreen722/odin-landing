# odin-landing
The purpose of this project is to put to the test some of the css and html skills I have picked up during my time learning with the odin project. I will be creating a webpage and doing my best to style it as shown in the images provided by the odin project curriculum. Some of my goals:
Commit early and often to build good habits with progess and regression
Use efficient and accurate styling techniques to recreate the webpage seen in the images
Use google when stuck and learn futher techniques through research
Give credit where due for any images used in the project
Enjoy the challenge and build some confidence with coding in general.
